`LineHeight` spaces out wrapped text, the way the engine does.

The multiplier is read, clamped to the 1…3 Studio allows, and spent **between** lines: `n` lines measure `TextSize + (n - 1) * TextSize * LineHeight`, so a one-line label is exactly `TextSize` tall however high its `LineHeight` is. CSS instead gives every line box the full `line-height`, half of the extra above the text and half below, so the leading is cropped off the two outer edges of the block — the paint then lands where `AutomaticSize` measured it.

A library that sets a per-variant `LineHeight` on every label (1.25 for a heading, 1.4 for body copy) got single-spaced paragraphs before this, and an `AutomaticSize.Y` container measured to match.
