/**
 * Build-time prerender: the `rbxassetid://` values a bundle cannot spell out.
 *
 * `./asset-proxy.ts` bakes the ids it can *read* in the emitted output, which
 * only finds the ones written as `rbxassetid://<digits>`. Real component
 * libraries compose them — `` `rbxassetid://${iconId}` `` over an icon table —
 * and after bundling that is a prefix, a `+`, and a few hundred bare numbers
 * indistinguishable from every other number in the chunk. Nothing is left to
 * match, so a static build painted no icons at all.
 *
 * So the ids are collected the only way that is exact: by *running* the scenes.
 * Every gallery target is mounted in node — happy-dom for the DOM, the real
 * react adapter, the real runtime — and the live instance tree is walked for
 * `Image` properties. That answers with what the page will actually ask for,
 * however the string was built, and nothing more: a 700-icon set contributes
 * the dozen icons the scenes really use.
 *
 * What it does *not* see is what the initial render does not reach — an icon
 * behind a hover state, or one a later network response supplies. Those stay
 * unresolved, which is the same place they were before this existed.
 *
 * Deliberately layout-free: `mountSync` takes a stub `computeLayout`, so the
 * WASM engine never loads and the mount is never sized. Nothing paints — the
 * DOM session has nothing to lay out — and the React tree, which is all this
 * needs, is built either way.
