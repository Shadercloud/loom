/**
 * `@rbxts/ripple` — loom's browser runtime for Ripple.
 *
 * Ripple ships a Luau runtime (`"main": "src/init.luau"`) and a `.d.ts`; there
 * is no JavaScript in the package at all. Left alone, Vite resolves the Luau
 * entry, the dev server hands the browser a file starting `local Ripple =
 * require(...)`, and `vite build` dies inside Rollup's JS parser. So the Vite
 * plugin aliases the package here instead — an exact-match redirect installed
 * before normal package resolution, in serve *and* build, so the dev server and
 * the static gallery run the same code.
 *
 * This is a port, not a stub: the spring integrator, the easing curves, the
 * Oklab color interpolation and the completion thresholds all follow the
 * published Luau source, so a component animates in loom the way it does in
 * Roblox. What is *not* supported fails loudly — see `./ripple/animatable.ts`.
 *
 * Supported values: `number`, `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Color3`, `UDim`, `UDim2`,
 * `Rect`, and records of numbers. `CFrame` throws: loom's `CFrame` carries no
 * rotation and the Scene IR has no property slot for one, so an interpolation
 * here could never reach the screen.
