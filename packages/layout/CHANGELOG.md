### Patch Changes

- [`ceb5b7e`](https://github.com/astra-void/loom/commit/ceb5b7ed4dbc452d776c14bb5090bb7efa0d1665) Thanks [@astra-void](https://github.com/astra-void)! - Run a real third-party roblox-ts UI library (`@rbxts/react-clean-ui`) end to end, and close every gap it hit:

  - `UIListLayout.Wraps` now wraps, per line, like CSS `flex-wrap` — lines break on the fill axis, each line aligns its own items, the stack of lines aligns as a block, flex distributes per line, and `AutomaticSize` measures the wrapped shape.
  - `UIShadow` renders as a CSS drop shadow, layered under a `UIStroke` ring instead of replacing it.
  - `ImageColor3` tints, through an `feColorMatrix` that is the same per-channel multiply the engine does — so a full-colour image tints as correctly as a monochrome icon. One filter per colour, none at all for the default white.
  - `RichText` markup is parsed and painted: `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<s>`, `<br/>`, `<font>` (colour, size, face, family, weight, transparency), `<uppercase>`/`<smallcaps>` and the character entities. With the flag off the same string stays literal, as in Roblox, and anything the engine would not recognise stays literal too. `AutomaticSize` measures each run in the font its own tags ask for, so a bold or resized run no longer clips the label.
  - `import ReactRoblox from "@rbxts/react-roblox"` works: the preview's stand-in exports the namespace object, matching upstream's `export =` typings.
  - The `rbxassetid://` route is built from the configured base again, so assets resolve under a mounted gallery (the Next integration, the Astro embed) instead of 404ing.
  - roblox-ts `.size()` / `.isEmpty()` resolve on `Map` and `Set`, through a symbol the preview rewrites previewed source to — leaving every other `Map` in the page (React's, loom's own scheduler) on plain JS semantics.
  - `UDim.add` / `UDim.sub`, `NumberSequence` / `NumberSequenceKeypoint`, and `BindableEvent` (`.Event`, `:Fire()`) are available to previewed code.
  - React's prop diff now uses Roblox `==`, which compares datatypes **by value**. A component that rebuilds `Position={UDim2.fromScale(.5,.5)}` every render no longer counts as a change, so a value written outside React — a drag moving a window, motion code on a ref — survives the next render instead of being overwritten.
  - `TextWrapped` text wraps. The deprecated `TextWrap` alias is read as the same property (Roblox's docs call it "simply an alias"), and measurement lays the runs into lines at word boundaries instead of always measuring one long line — constrained by the object's own width, or by the parent's when the X axis is automatic. Wrapped text is re-measured once the layout has sized its container, converging on the second pass.
  - A `GuiObject` the app listens to is hit-testable whether or not it is `Active`. Roblox's `Active` governs whether input is _sunk_, not whether the object hears it, so a slider handle — a plain `Frame` with an `InputBegan` handler — never received a pointer event. Frames with no listeners stay click-through, so a transparent positioning layer still lets clicks through to what is underneath.
  - The datatypes stringify the way the engine does (`Vector2` → `"2, 8"`, `UDim2` → `"{0.5, 10}, {0, 20}"`, `Color3` → `"1, 0, 0"`). A label reading `Range Slider (${value})` printed `[object Object]`.
  - `@rbxts/react`'s `Children.map` / `Children.forEach` count from **1**, as React-Lua does (`ReactChildren.lua` marks the line a ROBLOX DEVIATION). roblox-ts code recovering a 0-based position writes `index - 1`, so browser React's 0-based index shifted every result by one — a `<Select>` keyed on it selected and displayed its neighbour.
  - `UIListLayout` / `UIGridLayout` report `AbsoluteContentSize`, fed back after layout like the `ScrollingFrame` metrics and gated on real change. A dropdown that sizes itself from `Change={{ AbsoluteContentSize }}` collapsed to zero height without it, clipping away everything inside — click targets included.
  - An empty `TextBox` is measured against its `PlaceholderText`, which is what it displays. Measuring the empty string collapsed an `AutomaticSize.Y` input to zero height: invisible as well as unclickable.
  - Reading a `GuiObject` property nobody has written yields its Roblox default (`Visible`, `ZIndex`, `BackgroundTransparency`, `Rotation`, `LayoutOrder`, `Active`, `ClipsDescendants`, `AnchorPoint`, `Position`, `Size`) instead of `undefined`. App code that branches on one — a drag's `descendant.Visible` hit test — took the wrong path for every node.

### Minor Changes

- [#8](https://github.com/astra-void/loom/pull/8) [`68701b7`](https://github.com/astra-void/loom/commit/68701b77ce4bd0a31168687e83c4e08d683efd53) Thanks [@Shadercloud](https://github.com/Shadercloud)! - Add the legacy `FontSize` property, the Luau string methods and `assert`, and
  treat `Size` as a floor under `AutomaticSize`.

  - `Enum.FontSize` and the `FontSize` prop are supported end to end. The pixel
    size is read out of the enum name, so `FontSize={Enum.FontSize.Size24}` paints
    and measures at 24px. `TextSize` still wins when both are set, matching how
    Roblox keeps the two properties linked.
  - `String.prototype` gains the Luau string methods roblox-ts calls off a string
    receiver — `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.sub()`, `.rep()`, `.find()`, `.gsub()`
    and `.format()` — each delegating to the existing `string` library, so the
    1-based indices and tuple returns carry over. `.sub()` deliberately replaces
    the Annex B HTML wrapper JS ships under that name; `.split()` is deliberately
    left native, since Luau's `string.split` is implemented with it.
  - `assert` joins the installed Luau globals. It returns its argument when
    truthy, the way Luau does, so `const cfg = assert(maybeCfg, "no cfg")` works.
  - `AutomaticSize` no longer shrinks an element below its own `Size`. Roblox
    treats `Size` as the minimum and only grows past it for larger content; loom
    was overwriting the size with the content size outright, so a fixed-width
    container with a small child collapsed to the child.

### Minor Changes

- Support the modern Roblox UI surface: `FontFace`, flex layout, and tweens

  Four things a roblox-ts UI written today reaches for, which previews used to
  either ignore or die on:

  - **`FontFace` and the `Font` datatype.** `new Font(family, weight, style)` is a
    global, `Enum.FontWeight` / `Enum.FontStyle` exist, and the renderer resolves
    `FontFace` (preferred) or the legacy `Font` enum into a CSS family/weight/slant
    — including for `AutomaticSize` text measurement. `Font` is a new Scene IR
    property value, and `<textlabel FontFace={…} />` typechecks.
  - **`UIListLayout` flex and `UIFlexItem`.** `HorizontalFlex` / `VerticalFlex`
    spread leftover space along the fill axis (`SpaceBetween`, `SpaceAround`,
    `SpaceEvenly`, `Fill`) and stretch children across the cross axis (`Fill`);
    `UIFlexItem.FlexMode` grows an individual child (`Grow`/`Fill`, or `Custom`
    with `GrowRatio`).
  - **`TweenService`.** `Create`/`Play`/`Pause`/`Cancel`, `Completed`,
    `PlaybackState`, `GetValue`, every `EasingStyle`/`EasingDirection`, plus
    `DelayTime`, `RepeatCount` and `Reverses`. Tweens interpolate numbers,
    `Color3`, `UDim`, `UDim2` and `Vector2` on the scheduler's frame signal, so
    tweened writes flush like any other property write. Exported from
    `@loom-dev/preview/services`, so `import { TweenService } from "@rbxts/services"`
    resolves.
  - **`new ColorSequence(c0, c1)`.** The constructor now takes every form
    `ColorSequence.new` does. roblox-ts compiles the two-color factory call to the
    constructor, so a gradient built that way used to throw while the frame was
    being encoded.
